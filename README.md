Contact Number Validation: Verifies that the contact number 📞 is exactly 10 digits long and consists only of numbers 🔢.
Password Strength Validation: Enforces a minimum password length of 8 characters 📏 to ensure security 🛡️.
Password Match Validation: Ensures that the password 🔑 and confirm password 📝 fields match 🧩.

# 🚀 Use Case
This form validation system can be integrated into any web application 🌐 where user registration or data input 💼 needs validation. It prevents incorrect data entry 🚫 and reduces errors by alerting users 🔔 in real time if they fail to meet validation rules ✅.

Example Scenario

They are required to enter a UserID 🆔, contact number 📞, and password 🔑.
If any of the fields are incomplete ✏️ or the entered data does not meet the validation rules ⚠️ (e.g., invalid contact number or mismatched passwords 🔄), the form shows an alert 🔔.
